# SmartHome Python Application Prototype

This repository contains a Python-based **Smart Home Application Prototype** developed as part of the M30299 Programming module coursework at the University of Portsmouth. The project simulates a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing and interacting with smart home devices using Python's `Tkinter` library. The application is designed to demonstrate the functionalities of eco-friendly smart home technologies and their seamless control via a central interface.

## üè° Project Overview

This application was developed for **Alikoti**, a fictional UK-Finnish company specializing in eco-friendly smart home technologies. It provides a functional prototype for controlling smart devices such as smart plugs, smart lights, and other custom smart devices. The prototype is built with a clear focus on modularity, expandability, and user interactivity.

### Features:
1. **Smart Device Management**:
   - Includes functionality for toggling devices, setting parameters, and switching states.
   - Supports custom smart devices as per user-defined specifications.
2. **Tkinter GUI**:
   - A user-friendly interface displaying devices and their attributes.
   - Buttons for toggling individual devices or switching all devices on/off.
3. **Back-End Functionality**:
   - Classes for smart devices with attributes like `switchedOn`, consumption rate, and custom parameters.
   - A central `SmartHome` class for managing multiple devices.
4. **Testing**:
   - Comprehensive test functions for verifying class functionality.
5. **Challenge Enhancements**:
   - Includes optional features like real-time device count and customization windows for devices (optional).
